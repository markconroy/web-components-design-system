      <h1>Web Components Design System</h1>
      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to our <strong>Design System</strong>.</p>
      <p>This design system was built with nothing but HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no Node/NPM/Yarn/etc
        involved.
        There are no bundlers like Webpack or Vite. It doens't rely on a framework or design system kit such as
        StoryBook.
      </p>
      <p>Whilst there's nothing wrong with using any of the above, native web APIs are now so powerful there a huge
        amount
        we can build without their use.</p>
      <p>Why not use a tooling system? Simply, without one, there is so much less to maintain, and nothing to keep
        updated.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>General Approach</h2>
    <p>The general approach to this is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create design tokens using CSS variables (custom properties)</li>
      <li>Create some easy to use, memorable CSS utility classes for containers and grids</li>
      <li>Create Web Components for anything that is re-usable - header, footer, cards, etc.</li>
      <li>Retire to the sun!</li>
    </ul>
